# -TF2-Afterlife-plugin
When a player dies, he will be moved in a team and respawned, where the other "playing" players
 
won't see him and the player can't interact with the  (real) playing players.

This is only for testing for now. Official version will be published in the Sourcemod forum.

Please someone to test this plugin on his tf2 server.
